# uni_towns_prices
In June 2019 I completed the Introduction to Data Science course by the University of Michigan via Coursera.

My certificate for completion can be found [here](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/certificate/QWGL9AXF4N2G)

## Summary
The final project was to perform a hypothesis test, looking at the mean house prices before and after a recession and comparing houses in university towns to non-university towns.

## Techniques used
The course was heavily focused in teaching Pandas, and so a number of skills were used within this project:
 * Importing data
 * Regex
 * Merging datasets
 * Column calculations and manipulation
 * Function creation
 * For loops
 * Aggregating data with groupby
 * Performing a t-test
